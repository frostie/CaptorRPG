# CaptorRPG
In this 2D RPG adventure, you will embark on an expedition to capture some of the world's most exotic animals... But before you can catch them, you must solve mathematical problems - each more challenging than the last!

Note: This is a placeholder for a project that I will begin soon. I am currently working on a text-based version of the game.
